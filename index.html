<p>Welcome to Renter Relay.</p>

<p>The purpose of this application is to allow users to securely post photos, reviews, comments, pros, and cons about rental properties with which he/she has had personal experiences.</p>

<p>Think of Renter Relay as a 'glass door' between rental property tenants and property owners.</p>

<p>I want my users to be able to expose both good things and bad things about the rental properties in which they have lived and/or visited.</p>

<p>In the last 10 years, home ownership in the US has decreased sharply, to about 62% of the population. This means almost 40% of americans rent a home. And, we all know that renting can be a great financial burden for the tenant. Especially in areas, like Nashville, where population growth is at an all time high.</p>

<p>Giving prospective tenants a clearer view into a property for which he/she will be giving up a large percentage of income can make a huge difference as to where he/she ends up signing a lease. </p>

<p>If we as renters had access to certain types of information before we began to seek out rental properties, it may change where we look for a home or ultimately where we end up renting.</p>

<p>If you or I knew beforehand that a rental property we were considering had issues with working amenities or that perhaps the property owner or landlord was not very reliable in fulfilling their end of the lease agreement, we would have a serious reconsideration of that property.</p>

<p>Knowledge is power, and, in this case, having the type of knowledge that users of Rental Relay provide to one another could provoke a large shift in bargaining power between landlords and tenants. Knowing that a certain property has several factors that strike against it could in fact drive the rental cost of that property down. If more of us know that a property isn't worth what the owner is asking, in turn, we will be less likely to pay that inflated cost. And, to the property owner's advantage, if we all knew that a certain property was known to be worth what was being asked. Then, just as with anything else, the demand for that property (or that owner's other properties) would go up, and with it the rental cost, bringing that property owner more income due to his/her excellent service as a landlord.</p>

<p>My end goal for this project is to eventually collect enough user data that the possibilities for property owners to price gouge and/or treat tenants unfairly become drastically reduced. Likewise, the rental owners and landlords out there who work hard to provide their tenants with excellent services should be duly rewarded by a continual flow of business from more pleasant tenants who now know what to expect, which will make the renting process better for everyone involved.</p>
