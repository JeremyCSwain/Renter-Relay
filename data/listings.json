(i.e. dishwasher, garbage disposal, and washing machine all malfunction) Keeping the house cool in the summers was a constant battle.  The electric bill was about $400/mo on average, and the house was still very hot.  The landlord refused to do anything about the installation or current hvac system.  I do not recommend this property to the next tennant at all.  One of the bedrooms has a broken window that the landlord has not fixed for several months.",

The yard work is all taken care of, the home has new appliances throughout, there is a nice, fenced-in backyard, and the zip_code is awesome!  We've lived here for two years, and we have nothing but good things to say about the place.  The next tenants will be very happy.",
