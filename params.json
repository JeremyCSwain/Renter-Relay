This means almost 40% of americans rent a home. And, we all know that renting can be a great financial burden for the tenant. Especially in areas, like Nashville, where population growth is at an all time high.\r\n\r\nGiving prospective tenants a clearer view into a property for which he/she will be giving up a large percentage of income can make a huge difference as to where he/she ends up signing a lease. \r\n\r\nIf we as renters had access to certain types of information before we began to seek out rental properties, it may change where we look for a home or ultimately where we end up renting.\r\n\r\nIf you or I knew beforehand that a rental property we were considering had issues with working amenities or that perhaps the property owner or landlord was not very reliable in fulfilling their end of the lease agreement, we would have a serious reconsideration of that property.\r\n\r\nKnowledge is power, and, in this case, having the type of knowledge that users of Rental Relay provide to one another could provoke a large shift in bargaining power between landlords and tenants. Knowing that a certain property has several factors that strike against it could in fact drive the rental cost of that property down. If more of us know that a property isn't worth what the owner is asking, in turn, we will be less likely to pay that inflated cost. And, to the property owner's advantage, if we all knew that a certain property was known to be worth what was being asked. Then, just as with anything else, the demand for that property (or that owner's other properties) would go up, and with it the rental cost, bringing that property owner more income due to his/her excellent service as a landlord.\r\n\r\nMy end goal for this project is to eventually collect enough user data that the possibilities for property owners to price gouge and/or treat tenants unfairly become drastically reduced. Likewise, the rental owners and landlords out there who work hard to provide their tenants with excellent services should be duly rewarded by a continual flow of business from more pleasant tenants who now know what to expect, which will make the renting process better for everyone involved.\r\n\r\n",
